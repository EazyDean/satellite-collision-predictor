# Satellite Collision Predictor

This project predicts potential collisions between satellites based on TLE data using orbital mechanics.

## Features:
- TLE parsing and propagation
- Collision detection below 1km threshold
- Distance visualization
- Optional web interface with Streamlit

## How to Run
1. Clone repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Load TLEs and run propagation/collision check
